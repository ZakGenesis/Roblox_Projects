# Crypt Descent

**Description**:  
Crypt Descent is a game where players form teams to explore the depths of the catacombs of Paris. They retrieve lost treasure, sell it, and upgrade their gear for future expeditions. However, they must be carefulâ€”what they find in the depths may not always be friendly.

**Role**:  
I was the sole developer for this project. I handled all of the scripting and most of the assets for the game. The project was largely front-end focused, dealing with player interactions and visual design.

**Technologies used**:  
- Roblox Studio scripting (Lua).
- Frontend and backend scripting.
- Safe and optimized databases and player data storage.

**Status**:  
Project abandoned due to lack of time.  

**Key Features**:  
- Custom UI for teams, menus, managment and shop.
- Personalized lobby system.
- Team managment and high customization of settings.
