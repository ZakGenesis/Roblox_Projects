# Roamers: Unknown

**Description**:  
Roamers: Unknown is a survival game where players fight to survive against relentless undead enemies. Zombies use vision and line-of-sight mechanics to find players, and players must avoid or battle them to escape.

**Role**:  
As the sole developer, I handled all of the scripting. The assets used were taken from the toolbox. This project was primarily focused on backend mechanics such as AI behavior, pathfinding, and player interactions with zombies. There was a focus on high optimization and resource usage.

**Technologies used**:  
- Roblox Studio scripting (Lua).
- Zombie AI.
- Resource optimization mechanics.

**Status**:  
Project still running, no future updates planned.
